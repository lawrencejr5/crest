          Masternode secure yields for crypto assets enthusiasts, masternode is a crisis resistance system designed to yield
          profits for investors through cryptocurrency; an alternate way to make revenue in blockchain technology and relies
          on a proof-of-stake(POS) approach.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
          Masternode is not crypto trading/forex trading program but a “pay for service” system that generates profits based
          on a mathematical algorithm ingrained within each master-noded coin.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
          In Masternode loss of capital is highly unlikely. Naturally, there are expenses, but servers are rented and
          contracts can be canceled. Clearly, fluctuations in coin prices affect the market, and master node earnings are
          always in coins, But since the deposited stake become free again when a master node is switched off,
          Gatewaycapital can pay back deposits at any time.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
          Assured profit is all about Masternode because, your capital will be returned along with any accrued profits.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-3">
          Masternode is NOT a forex trading scheme. The participants funds are used to rent servers and supercomputers that
          master-node age generate coins that we sell. It’s more of a rental program and should be viewed as such!. Rest
          assured- safety of your capital takes highest priority.
