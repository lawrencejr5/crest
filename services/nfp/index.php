          The US economic calendar is stacked with many events throughout the month but none is more anticipated that the
          release of Non-Farm Payroll figures. Non-Farm Payrolls also known as NFP, is reported monthly by the US Bureau of
          Labour Statistics to give a timely glimpse into employment changes inside of the United States.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-">
          Ultimately this report can give traders insight into whether the US economy is expanding or contracting while
          directly influences the decisions of policy makers such as the US Federal Reserve. With this in mind let’s take a
          closer at this news event, so we can better understand NFP and its potential impact on marks.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-">
          First, NFP looks specifically at net changes in employment as jobs are created or subtracted in an economy in any
          given month. The term Non-Farm is used since farm / agricultural workers are not included in the employment count.
          The decision to not include agricultural jobs lies in these jobs being largely seasonal that could possibly
          produce
          small temporary shifts in labour reporting.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-">
          For this reason certain government employees, private household employees and non-profit organization are also not
          included in the count. NFP figures are known to have significant swings. Traders often speculate on these changes
          in
          NFP figures, which often causes market volatility on the day of their release, NFP numbers have been known to
          produce volatility in the Forex Market.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-">
          Considering what occurred during the last month’s NFP release on a USD/JPY 5min chart. NFP was released at 8:30 am
          ET and the numbers came out at 227k, significantly better than initial expectations of 180k. During this time the
          USD/JPY declined as much as 91 pips in the first 5 minutes of trading. Over the course of the next 2 hours, the
          USD/JPY eventually fell as much as 113 pips! Using fundamental analysis and historical data a short-term high risk
          position is traded winning traders up-to 1000x leverage and significant profit ratio because traders, retail and
          institutional (huge), make educated guesses (bets) before and during the announcement.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-">
          The U.S NFP is a key fundamental announcement that happens every month, since a lot of people are trading it, that
          drives up volume and in turn leads to higher volatility (bigger moves) . This is all driven by market sentiment .
