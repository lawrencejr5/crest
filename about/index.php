              <p>Assetvest Trading was created in 2009 with the sole purpose of ensuring that everyone has an insight into investments and has made sure that anyone that crosses our path has a genuine encounter with the investment market. Our aim is to help others achieve their aim in life, we saw the opportunity to help others and we took it, and so are we passionate about it. Investments are life savers and shouldn’t be rejected by anyone, you’re helping yourself and no one else, this goes to answer the question of “why do I invest?” Basically, all directions lead to this and a strong reason is having something in store for a rainy day, or making a life-changing decision that would require a lot of financial support and how to do this. This is where we come in, this is where we help you by investing your money in solid asset that will yield more dividends over a short period of time. We believe in empowering novice investors and also the experts (you are all important to us).<br />
                <br />
                       Assetvest Trading was a business built from the ground up, addressing a very sincere and genuine need in the market; to be a fund manager who can be trusted and relied upon by every trader. In 2014, the fund management services were offered internationally, after a year of only offering these services nationally. This was to achieve larger investor subscriptions and have a worldwide business in tandem with the changing cultures of the Twenty-first Century. As of 2014, our monthly volume flow was approximately 200 million USD (notional), for a collective AUM (Assets Under Management) of slightly under USD 80m.<br />
                <br />
                     These amounts are ever-growing. As early as 2013, the founders of Assetvest Trading , LLC started promoting invention and innovation. Until 2014, the founding fund managers and active traders of Assetvest Trading were operating under their own individual operations, including a variety of private funds. In 2015 the infrastructure already in place was finally offered to retail market traders under the name Assetvest Trading. The entire institutional platform, liquidity, and clearance engine were leveraged to provide for retail market flow. Until 2014 the founding fund managers and active traders of Assetvest Tradingwere sailing their own ships. In 2014 they anchored and decided to sail together. From 2014 until 2015, the founders of Assetvest Trading started implementing collective structures. In early 2014, the Assetvest Trading founders ceased multiple fund offerings to the public and started practising under a single closed fund instead. Fund management services were still offered for public subscription but were moved under a closed fund with a private company. This achieved more prudent fund management practices and decreased commercialization by the various providers.<br />
                <br />
                Assetvest Trading Launched its new site and the primary colours chosen were White, Blue, and Green. The colours, in combination, complemented each other pretty well. White symbolizes purity, and transparency and gives an easy and minimalistic feel to the eyes and this reinforces the transparency we maintain in our business practices, customer support, payout procedure, etc. Blue represents the uniqueness that personifies trading, which appeals to a special few. Green represents wisdom applied to achieve successful trade results. We believe you should be comfortable around us, which is why we branded ourselves with friendly colours. Assetvest Trading has maintained regularly updated self-examination software which it uses to measure the satisfaction of its clients with its services. Since 2014, Assetvest Trading has maintained 100% satisfaction rate among its short-term and long-term clients. Assetvest Trading is a part of the Investors Compensation Fund in the USA, Asians and in Europe. As a signatory.<br />
